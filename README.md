# Ruby Tic-Tac-Toe Project

## Project Overview

I am excited to share the "Ruby Tic-Tac-Toe" project, a key part of the "Object Oriented Programming Basics" section in the "Full Stack Ruby on Rails" path offered by The Odin Project. This project is more than just a game; it's an exploration into object-oriented programming in Ruby, showcasing the power and simplicity of the language in creating interactive applications.

Tic-Tac-Toe, while simple in concept, provides a perfect platform to delve into the nuances of Ruby programming, from managing game logic to handling user interaction.

## Key Learning Objectives

In undertaking this project, my goals are to demonstrate proficiency in:

- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Utilizing Ruby's OOP capabilities to structure the game efficiently.
- **User Interaction**: Handling input/output within the command line to create an engaging user experience.
- **Game Logic Implementation**: Developing the core mechanics of Tic-Tac-Toe, ensuring a smooth and error-free gameplay experience.
- **Git & GitHub Usage**: Continuously using version control for effective tracking of changes and clear documentation of the development process.

## Project Description

The core of this project lies in creating a fully functional Tic-Tac-Toe game in Ruby. Key features include:

- A command-line interface for players to interact with the game.
- A robust game engine that handles the game logic, including checking for wins or draws.
- Dynamic player input to place their 'X' or 'O' on the board.

For example, a typical game flow might look like this:

``Ruby
# Example of a game round
play_round(player1, player2, game_board)
# Players take turns marking the board, and the game announces the winner or a draw.
``


## Getting Started

Key steps in the development of this project included:

 - **Repository Setup**: Initializing a GitHub repository to track the development stages of the project.

 - **Game Logic Development**: Focusing on implementing the rules and logic of Tic-Tac-Toe in Ruby.

 - **User Interface Design**: Crafting a simple yet intuitive command-line interface for player interaction.

  - **Testing and Refinement**: Ensuring the game runs smoothly and handles different game scenarios effectively.

## Conclusion

The "Ruby Tic-Tac-Toe" project has been a remarkable journey into the realms of Ruby programming and game development. As I progress through The Odin Project, I look forward to tackling more complex challenges, enhancing my skills in Ruby, and furthering my journey in software development.
